# chinese-jargon
internet and gamer jargon in English and Chinese

## structure
the source content is in /rawdata

The github pages are from the `docs` directory. Visible here:

https://dcsan.github.io/chinese-jargon/


## making a release
There's a script `bin/build.sh` that will basically just copy the rawdata into `docs/data`
at a later date we will transform the CSV files into more useful formats like JSON etc. and make them easier to display.
